=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use JIP::LockFile;

    my $lock_file = '/path/to/pid_file';

    my $foo = JIP::LockFile->new(lock_file => $lock_file);
    my $wtf = JIP::LockFile->new(lock_file => $lock_file);

    $foo->lock;           # lock
    eval { $wtf->lock; }; # or raise exception

    # Can check its status in case you forgot
    $foo->is_locked; # 1
    $wtf->is_locked; # 0

    $foo->lock; # Re-locking changes nothing

    # But trying to get a lock is ok
    $wtf->try_lock;  # 0
    $wtf->is_locked; # 0

    # You can manually unlock
    $foo->unlock;

    # Re-unlocking changes nothing
    $foo->unlock;

    # ... or unlocking is automatic on scope exit
